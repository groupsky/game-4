# Challenge Progression Analysis

## Current Progression Review

### BASICS (1-10): ✅ GOOD PROGRESSION

| # | Challenge | New Concept | Issue |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | First Light | LED + Battery basics | ✅ Perfect intro |
| 2 | Power Up | Series batteries (voltage) | ✅ One new concept |
| 3 | Current Control | Resistor protection | ✅ Builds on #2 |
| 4 | The Warm Glow | Light bulb (higher power) | ✅ New component |
| 5 | Battery Blues | Time-based challenge (30s) | ✅ Duration concept |
| 6 | Parallel Power | Parallel batteries (capacity) | ✅ One new concept |
| 7 | Double Bright | Parallel LEDs | ✅ Applies #6 knowledge |
| 8 | Energy Bank | Capacitor introduction | ✅ New component |
| 9 | Flash Photography | Capacitor burst (high voltage) | ✅ Applies #8 |
| 10 | Capacitor Bank | Parallel capacitors | ⚠️ Should be after series caps? |

**Basics Summary:** Excellent progression. Each level introduces ONE new concept. #10 might be better after series capacitors are introduced.

### INTERMEDIATE (11-20): ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

| # | Challenge | New Concept | Issue |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 11 | Energy Storage Mastery | Capacitor discharge | ✅ Deepens #8 knowledge |
| 12 | Triple Chain | 3 LEDs in series (voltage division) | ✅ Extends #2 concept |
| 13 | LED Array | 3x3 grid (series + parallel) | ⚠️ **DIFFICULTY SPIKE** - combines #12 + #7 |
| 14 | Voltage Divider | Resistor voltage division | ✅ New resistor concept |
| 15 | Endurance Test | 2 LEDs for 90s | ✅ Combines time + parallel |
| 16 | RC Timing | Resistor-capacitor delay | ✅ New RC concept |
| 17 | Power Efficiency | 1 battery challenge | ✅ Efficiency focus |
| 18 | Maximum Brightness | Optimize LED power | ✅ Optimization focus |
| 19 | Battery Bank | 3x3 battery array | ⚠️ Similar to #13 complexity |
| 20 | Marathon Run | 2 minute bulb test | ✅ Endurance challenge |

**Issues:**
- **#13 (LED Array)**: Too complex too soon. Should have gradual steps:
  - First: 2x2 grid (4 LEDs)
  - Then: 3x3 grid (9 LEDs)
- **#19 (Battery Bank)**: Very similar to #13 pattern. Feels repetitive.

### ADVANCED (21-30): ⚠️ PROGRESSION ISSUES

| # | Challenge | New Concept | Issue |
|---|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 21 | Dual Power | LED + bulb together | ✅ Load balancing |
| 22 | Advanced Capacitor Network | Complex cap network | ❌ **VAGUE** - what exactly? |
| 23 | Series Capacitors | Caps in series | ✅ Should be BEFORE #10! |
| 24 | Mixed Load | Series + parallel LEDs | ⚠️ Already done in #13 |
| 25 | Resistor Ladder | 3 resistor chain | ⚠️ Similar to #14 |
| 26 | Power Distribution | 1 bank, 3 branches | ⚠️ Similar to #7, #13 |
| 27 | Sustained Flash | Batteries + caps (45s) | ✅ Good combination |
| 28 | Efficiency Master | 3 LEDs, 3 batteries (60s) | ✅ Optimization |
| 29 | The Grand Circuit | Ultimate combination | ✅ Capstone challenge |
| 30 | Master Inventor | 5+ components (90s) | ✅ Final test |

**Major Issues:**
- **#22**: Too vague - needs specific requirements
- **#23**: Series capacitors should come BEFORE parallel (#10)
- **#24**: Redundant with #13
- **#25**: Too similar to #14
- **#26**: Feels like repeat of earlier challenges

## Recommended Changes

### Re-order Capacitor Concepts:
- Move #23 (Series Capacitors) to position #10
- Move #10 (Parallel Capacitors) to position #11

### Replace Redundant Challenges:

**#22 (Advanced Capacitor Network)** → **"Capacitor Smoothing"**
- Use capacitor to smooth power delivery to LED
- Demonstrates filtering/smoothing concept
- Clear specific goal

**#24 (Mixed Load)** → **"Power Splitting"**
- Use voltage divider to power 2 LEDs at different brightnesses
- Introduces intentional voltage control
- More focused concept

**#25 (Resistor Ladder)** → **"Current Limiting Network"**
- Use resistors to limit current to exact safe levels
- Introduces precision circuit design
- Practical application

**#26 (Power Distribution)** → **"Load Management"**
- Power 3 different load types (LED, bulb, capacitor) from one bank
- Balance power distribution
- Real-world skill

### Simplify LED Array:

**#13 (LED Array)** → **"Four Lights"**
- 2x2 grid (4 LEDs) instead of 3x3
- Gentler introduction to grid patterns
- Save 3x3 for later challenge

**Add new #19.5**: "Nine Lights"
- 3x3 LED grid (moved from #13)
- Now player has more experience
